# Software Development Exercise

- Objective Build a website with a database backend for storing a movie collection. Please use PHP or NodeJS to deliver the application on whatever server infrastructure you prefer.
1. Start by creating a development environment of your choosing. Let us know what you’ll
be implementing. 2. Setup a source code repository where we can watch your progress. GitHub or Bitbucket
are fine. 3. You’ll need to deploy your application to a hosting service of your choosing (AWS,
DigitalOcean, Azure, etc). Free tiers should be sufficient.
Requirements
1. Give the app a “branded” unique name, with an associated look and feel. You can
leverage standard frontend libraries as necessary. 2. The app must create, read, update, delete, and list movies in the collection 3. Each movie in the collection needs the following attributes:
a. Title [text; length between 1 and 50 characters] b. Format [text; allowable values “VHS”, “DVD”, “Streaming”] c. Length [time; value between 0 and 500 minutes] d. Release Year [integer; value between 1800 and 2100] e. Rating [integer; value between 1 and 5] 4. App requires a landing page (index), listing page, and details page/view. Create
menus/links as appropriate to navigate the site. 5. Responsive design is required to support multiple screen sizes. 6. On the collection list page, the items in the list must be sortable by movie attributes.
Extra Credit (none, any, or all)
1. Implement a build tool of your choosing 2. Add a user model and authentication 3. Integrate a third-party web service relevant to the project 4. Integrate a testing suite of some sort
Keep In Mind
1. We want to see your progress, not just a finished product. Email us your source code repository and a link to your application instance as soon as you have them setup. 2. Stay in communication with us (ask questions, give status updates). This is part of the
challenge.
